# crowsfoot

A theme for the [Pelican](http://www.getpelican.com) static site generator.
Looks good, puts words on the internet, doesn't do anything fancy.

## Installation

`git clone https://github.com/porterjamesj/crowsfoot.git`

Then set the pelican config variable `THEME` to the cloned path.

## Usage

All of your pages and menuitems are dispalyed in the nav.

You can also add icon links to your profile on various internet
services by defining the appropriate config variables

* `EMAIL_ADDRESSS`
* `GITHUB_ADDRESS`
* `SO_ADDRESS` (Stackoverflow)
* `TWITTER_ADDRESS`
* `FB_ADDRESS` (Facebook)

An RSS icon will also show on the nav if `FEED_RSS` is set.
